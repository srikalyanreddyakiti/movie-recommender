# 🎬 Movie Recommender

A genre-based movie recommendation system built with Python and Flask that filters and displays movie suggestions based on user-selected preferences and historical rating data. This project demonstrates logic-based filtering without any machine learning or AI components.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Recommends movies based on selected genres  
- Uses preprocessed movie and rating datasets  
- Simple and interactive web interface  
- No AI or ML used — purely logic-based filtering  

## 📁 Project Structure  
- `app.py` – Flask web server script  
- `MRS.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for dataset merging and exploration  
- `movies_with_ratings.pkl` – Pickled DataFrame combining movies and ratings  
- `vectorizer.pkl` – (Optional, for potential text processing extension)  
- `movies.csv` – Movie metadata (title, genres, release year)  
- `ratings.csv` – User ratings for movies  
- `templates/` – HTML templates for the UI (`home.html`, `movies.html`)  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 🧪 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Flask  
- pandas, numpy  
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Datasets  
- `movies.csv`: Contains movie titles, genres, and release years  
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps  

## 💡 Applications
